    "expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called \n",
    "specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation \n",
    "is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and \n",
    "when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced \n",
    "the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.\n",

    "iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.\n",
    "next() keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",
    "After the iterable object is completed, to use them again reassign them to the same object.\n",

    "iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function \n",
    "returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a\n",
